# BeeGame
CMU 15-112 Term Project
"Don't Worry, Bee Happy :D"

The objective of this game is to pollinate as many flowers as possible before 
the timer reaches 0. A bee graphic follows the cursor as the user moves it 
around the screen. Flowers move across the screen. The bee can gather pollen 
from solid flowers and carry the pollen orbs. Flowers can only be gathered once. 
The bee can pollinate ringed flowers with pollen of a matching color from 
its inventory. Helper bees also move around the screen and pollinate flowers.
A special flower gets spawned periodically. If the bee gathers from the special
flower, its functioning is temporarily impaired.  

To play this game, the code file "BeeProjectV10.py" and the "cmu_112_graphics.py" file must be saved
in the same folder.
